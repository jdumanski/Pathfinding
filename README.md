# Pathfinding
Pathfinding visualizer:

This is a pathfinding visualizer, programmed in Java using the JavaFX library. It is able to execute both Dijktra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm for finding the shortest path from a start to end node. The viusalizer animates the nodes that are progressively visited, as well as the final shortest path. 

The user can place their own obstacles on the grid to block which will act as walls. Alternatively, there is a preset that will randomly set nodes on the grid as walls. 

If a path is not possible, the program will display this on the screen.

I am currently continuing to work on it by potentially adding more pathfinding algorithms and additional functionality to the application.
